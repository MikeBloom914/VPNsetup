Create a vps if you don't have one on Digital Ocean.
Follow instructions on how to get your key associated with your new node.

Simply run "myprocedure.py" and make sure you have "myprocedure.sh" in the same folder to create and log in to your new secure vps!!!

Follow the instructions and enter "yes" when prompted and watch the program set up your new vps, secured, and tested with the installed programs which you will see once you are done/logged in.

I hope I made this process easier for you!  If so, please follow me as I try to make your life easier!  Thanks and enjoy!
